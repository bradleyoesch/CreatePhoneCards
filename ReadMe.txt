How to create the virtual phone cards, downloadable by smartphone.

Running CreatePhoneCards.jar will create three .vcf files, one with brothers 
info, one with pledges info, and one with both. Follow these instructions 
to easily create the phone cards and not have to do all that laminating 
and cutting stuff that makes you feel like a fifth grader in arts and crafts.
That's the whole reason I wrote this program.

1. Open the current Secretary worksheet. This program is based off the Fall
   2013 Secretary Worksheet, but it should be the same for future semesters.
2. Click on the Active Roster tab. Click File > Download as > Plain text
3. Rename this file "Info Brothers.tsv".
4. Click on the Pledge Roster tab. Click File > Download as > Plain text
5. Rename this file "Info Pledges.tsv".
6. Place both files in same folder as the .jar file, preferably in a newly named
   folder following convention like "SPRING 2014".
7. Run "CreatePhoneCards.jar".
8. Open the newly created files in a text editor like Notepad or TextEdit to 
   see if it worked. If they're not empty, it probably worked correctly.
9. To fully test, email the files to yourself and see if you can add the 
   contacts to your phone. They should now come up in searches and when 
   drafting emails, if you use the initials emailing convention, then the 
   correct brother will show up as a selectable recipient.

If it didn't work, check to see if the .tsv files are formatted the same as 
the "Info Brothers Test.tsv" or "Info Pledges Test.tsv" files
